# SparkFun Inventor's Kit Refactors

I've created this repository as a supplement to the *IT Innovators* 2020 Summer course at the Westminster Schools of Atlanta, Georgia.

Here you'll find my refactorizations and expansions on the wonderful coding projects presented in the [SparkFun Inventor's Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15267)

The most prominent change you will notice is the removal of almost all comments outside the heading of the file. This is because I believe that comments present opportunities for **misinformation**, as the code they are meant to describe changes and they are left behind (I call this "drift").

Instead, I've carefully re-worked variable names to make them more expressive and abstracted what were once in-line expressions into functions for the sole purpose of giving them a name and making the code more readable.

Happy coding!
